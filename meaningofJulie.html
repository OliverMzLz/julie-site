    J, Jewel
    <br><br>
    Jewel is one word, that can't nearly come close to you speciality of being you, but unfortunetly, being bounded 
    with the words that I can use, its the closest thing, that could come to explaining how much of a rarity you truly 
    are Julie. They say that some of the most beautiful jewels are formed under enourmose amounts of pressure, and thats
    something I really admire about you. Even during all of your hardships, during the moments where, it seemed as though,
    things weren't getting better, you never once lashed out, blamed others, or even felt the need to put others down to elevate
    yourself. Your need to be independent and stay strong, is something I honestly really admire of you, and something I truly do
    see on a regular basis of you. Your want to feel strong, even by yourself is amazing, and understandable, considering what
    you have gone through in the past. Where reliancy can feel entraping, can feel scary, that feeling of not being able to pick
    youself up, but instead trusting someone else. I hope to be that person that you can always trust. That person, that you know
    would never abandon you, leave, betray or backstab. I hope, I have somewhat shown you not just through my words, but by my actions. 
    On May 16th of 2024, when you told me, that you would be losing your phone, and had no idea when you may ever get it back, I remember
    feeling distraught and sad, but knew deep down I would hold on to the hope, that you would be back. Then came the most grueling, most 
    hard 7 months of my life. I didn't just lose "you", I had lost a part of my day, my daily routine, the person I looked forward to, the most
    was now gone. But just like I knew, you would continue on, I knew I had to as well. I waited and waited, and even reached out to those,
    that I could around you, till finally, you were here. I honestly look up to your toughness, and see you as a inspiration, as someone 
    that even through the worst moments, could have such high spirit, you whent through enourmous pressure, just like a jewel, and even now
    you shine just as bright, and beautifully, as the day I met you.
    <br><br>
    
    U, Unforgettable
    <br><br>
    I know that for the longest time Julie, you've always been the one to remember. Remember everything, about everyone, but the moment it
    came for Julie? It seemed as though every falls flat on you. But for me, there was no topic, no detail, and no fact that was too little for me
    to know about you. I truly have never met anyone, even remotely close to you, and if anything, it goes to show, how much of a rarity you are in
    this world. When you first left, all that was ever on my mind, was wondering what you were doing, if you were safe, and okay. Someone as preciouse 
    as you, only deserves the rightful treatment that you have given to the world. I can only remember the times, where I would find myself scrolling
    through our old text messages, seeing how much fun we had, and how often we spoke. During those moments when you were away, it made me realize That
    I truly did take those moments for granted and never realized, how special, they would become, not just in my memory, but deep in my heart. honestly,
    I hope in every world, I meet you, whether its us as humans, ducks, and even monkeys lol. Even till today, sometimes i'll look up to the sunset or early 
    sky, and see a mix of pink, and all I can think of now, is how much you would have loved to see it. From your natural laugh, to your sense of humor,
    to the amazing moments we have had, and to hopefully the many more that will come. Its really sad, that I had to go nearly half a year without hearing 
    from you, but in a way, it only showed me, how much more Unforgettable you truly are. From your kind words, to your gentle support, you truly have been a once
    in a life time person, it only makes me want to hold onto you even tighter then, I was before. Makes me want to never let you go. 
    <br><br>

    L, Luminous
    <br><br>
    You know in a world, where being mean, cold, and nonchalant, there should always be a light at the end. You are that light. During my time of knowing you, whether Its
    before or after our long hiatus, you were there always there. I can remember from the times we talked, how much you enjoy your time to yourself, and how sometimes you just need
    that time to yourself, whether it be to recharge or just need that valuable alone time, but know even the memories of you in my head, were enough to keep me company when you were gone.
    Honestly, anyone who has the opportunity to get to know you, I hope truly understand the gift that comes with having you in their lifes. You always want to be everyones light, and be their
    person for them. But one thing I worry, is that you are always everyones light, but I never want you to lose your spark. There are days, where im afraid, that you feel that your
    spark is somehow a burden or annoying to others, when thats absolutely not the case. The empathy that you bring out when others truly need it, is something I really do admire about you. 
    Sometimes I wonder how you truly do it, and worry that sometimes you may feel as if, you are losing control over how you feel, since you are so busy helping others. But I don't want you to feel that way
    ever, I want you to feel secure, and strong. I understand that there was a time, where it may have felt as though you were there for everyone, but maybe it felt like nobody was ever there for you,
    but know, that while my light may not shine as bright as yours, I always will keep it lit, to help you see.
    <br><br>

    I, irreplaceable
    <br><br>
    I have met countless of people, many kind, many mean, some in the middle. Though all of them had similarities, whether it was small or big, but I can 
    truly say, that in my 21 years of living, I have truly never met someone like you before in my life. Someone so strong and someone so adamant on being able
    to move forward. Its something I truly do love about you, and enjoy seeing you do. From your strengths, to youe gentle care, You always seem to know what needs to
    be said, and always seem to know when something may be up. When I first met you on some playful game on roblox, I would have never guessed that one simple person could
    make such an impact on me. You were there when no one else was, and would be there for anyone if you knew you could be. From your sweet heart, to your gentle smile, that im sure
    could bring up anyones day, you truly are an angel to this world, and I still have no idea, what may have gotten the world, to decide for us to meet, but to this day,
    im so thankful for it. I know that this world has been hard, and life at times may have been too overwhelming for you, and I honestly wish at times, we could switch places,
    where you can have more stability, hapiness and joy, and I could take on your burdens. At times, it may feel like you may overthink, but know if you ever do, ill become a 
    overexplainer, I have zero issues with ever being there for you, and in any way possible, for me to make your mind at ease. Because to me, you're more then just who you think you are
    Know that you are you, and that you are more then just enough. You are more, youve given this world so much, and are going to be giving it so much more. You are you, and I hope you know,
    that no matter what, youll always be enough for me.     
    <br><br>

    E, Empathetic
    <br><br>
    Your ability to understand how others feel is both amazing, and tragic. Amazing would be a understatement, for the many good things that have come out of you. You have always wanted
    to be there for others, even if that meant they wouldn't be there for you. But nobody learns empathy just through error and trial, but through first hand counts of what its like to have
    always wanted someone to be like that for you. I can remember the moments you have told me, whether it be with the people that have betrayed you, disregarded you, or pushed you off,
    instead of knowing how much of a absolute blessing you are to have. You see everyones own problems and you almost insert yourself into it, in order to give them the best possible outlook.
    You never harshly judge others, but always want to try you best to protect everyones peace, even those that may have done you wrong. I understand that the world has been so hard on you,
    and even with your empathy, it sometimes may feel as if somethings may not get better, or that possibly it may just be better to accept that things won't get better. Always know, that I will be here,
    during the bad, and the good, and even if things don't get better, i'll sit right beside you, and embrace the moment with you. You have been so empathetic, but sometimes it feels as though, you were left
    behind. That feeling of thinking that, those around you may not care about you, or that view that you aren't as important than you may think. When in reality, you mean the world to me. Always know, 
    that your empathy is one of your greatest strengths, and to know, you will have me in this world.
